# Getting Started

Try to create homepage+blog with Github Pages & Jekyll :D

## Create homepage
* Create Github account & Login.
* Goto https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter and click on "Use this template" and select "Create a new repository".
* While creating the new repository, make it public. This is required to create Github Pages.
* In the "Settings" tab, set up the Repository name as https://{username}.github.io/ where username is your Github username.
* Goto "Code" tab, then edit "_config.yml" file with "title", "tagline", "url", "social", "avatar", etc. This should be enough to launch the site https://{username}.github.io/

## Create posts
* The above process does, indeed, clone Jekyll's template from chirpy-starter repository.
* This creates several files and folders required by Jekyll.
* To create new post, goto folder _posts, and create new file with name "YYY-MM-DD-name.md" and edit it.
* This will automatically add new post to the site https://{username}.github.io/
